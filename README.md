# neurofun-nft-marketplace

This is a pet (fun) project allowing to mint neuro-related NFTs and list/sell/buy them on an NFT Marketplace Goerli Testnet.
THIS IS A TEST PROJECT, NOT A REAL PROJECT!

---

## Tech Stack

- Solidity
- Hardhat
- ReactJS, NextJS
- The Graph
- Moralis
- Open Zeppelin
- Apollo Client

---

## Back-End

2 Smart Contracts (+1 mock):

## Front-End

NTF Marketplace
NTF - on Ethereum (testnet)

Solidity (for writing Smart Contract) with Hardhat in VS Code
NextJS (for front-end), alongside with Web3UIKit and TailwindCSS

For the NFT images and metadata storage I'm using IPFS and Pinata to pin to IPFS path or URI.

For Indexing the events from the blockchain I'm using The Graph a Decentralized indexer. Think Google of the Blockchain but decentralized.

For the Random Number Generator since the NFTs are generated randomly, I'm using ChainLink VRF. ChainLink is the main service provider for Off-Chain stuff. (when you need to bring off-chain data or insights like the price of an asset or real-world sensor sates or whatever)

And finally the whole code is available on GitHub and the website deployed on Netlify for a live website, not just a localhost version.
I'm not expecting anyone to use it nor try it, but I wanted to complete the full circle up to deploying it.

I had so much fun doing this little pet project and learning more about blockchain dev, tools and tech stack.

Let's get right into it!
